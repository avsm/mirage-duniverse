mirage-channel â€” Buffered channels for MirageOS FLOW types
----------------------------------------------------------
%%VERSION%%

Channels are buffered reader/writers built on top of unbuffered `FLOW`
implementations.

Example:

```ocaml
module Channel = Channel.Make(Flow)
...
Channel.read_exactly ~len:16 t
>>= fun bufs -> (* read header of message *)
let payload_length = Cstruct.(LE.get_uint16 (concat bufs) 0) in
Channel.read_exactly ~len:payload_length t
>>= fun bufs -> (* payload of message *)

(* process message *)

Channel.write_buffer t header;
Channel.write_buffer t payload;
Channel.flush t
>>= fun () ->
```

## Installation

mirage-channel can be installed with `opam`:

    opam install channel

If you don't use `opam` consult the [`opam`](opam) file for build
instructions.

## Documentation

The documentation and API reference is automatically generated by
`ocamldoc` from the interfaces. It can be consulted [online][doc]
and there is a generated version in the `doc` directory of the
distribution.

[doc]: http://docs.mirage.io/channel

## Sample programs

If you installed mirage-channel with `opam` sample programs are located in
the directory `opam config var channel:doc`.

In the distribution sample programs and tests are located in the
[`test`](test) directory of the distribution. They can be built with:

    ./build test

The resulting binaries are in `_build/test`.

- `test.native` tests the library, nothing should fail.
