(** [Make] builds a module that is like [Iobuf], except that the module also has some
    controls for whether the various Iobuf functions do invariant checking and/or show
    debug messages.  Initially, the [bool ref]'s are [true].

    The performance of the functions in the module resulting from [Make] can be much worse
    than that of a plain [Iobuf], even with all the controls set to [false].

  (** We use [module type of struct include Iobuf end] rather than [module type of Iobuf]
      so that the debugging functions work on normal Iobufs. *)
