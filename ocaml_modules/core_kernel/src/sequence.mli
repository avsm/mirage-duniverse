(** Merges elements from sequences that are assumed to be sorted by [compare] to produce a
    sequence also sorted by [compare]. If any of the inputs are not sorted, the order of
    the output is not guaranteed to be sorted.

    This includes duplicate elements in the output (whether they occur within
    one input sequence, or across different input sequences).
