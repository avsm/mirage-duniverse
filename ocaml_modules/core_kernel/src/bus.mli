(** A [Bus] is a publisher/subscriber system within the memory space of the program.  A
    bus has a mutable set of subscribers, which can be modified using [subscribe_exn] and
    [unsubscribe].

    [create] returns a [Bus.Read_write.t], which you can use to [write] values to the bus.
    [write] calls the callbacks of all current subscribers before returning.

    In a [('callback, 'phantom) Bus.t], ['phantom] is a read-write phantom type that
    controls whether one can read values from or write values to the bus.  The phantom
    type states the capabilities one could ever have access to, not the capabilities that
    are immediately available.  In particular, if one wants to subscribe to a
    [Bus.Read_write.t], one must call [read_only] on it in order to get a
    [Bus.Read_only.t] that can be passed to [subscribe_exn].  This is deliberate, and is
    meant to avoid unintentional reads from code that should only be writing.

(** [Callback_arity] states the type of callbacks stored in a bus. Using [Callback_arity]
    is an implementation technique that allows callbacks to be defined as ordinary n-ary
    curried functions (e.g., [a1 -> a2 -> a3 -> r]), instead of forcing n-ary-variadic
    callbacks to use tuples (e.g., [a1 * a2 * a3 -> r]).  This also avoids extra
    allocation.

    When reading the bus interface, keep in mind that each ['callback] is limited, through
    [create], to the types exposed by the variants in [Callback_arity]. *)
