(** Module for dealing with TUN/TAP devices. TUN refers to layer 3
    virtual interfaces whereas TAP refers to layer 2 ones. *)

val opentun : ?pi:bool -> ?persist:bool -> ?user:int
  -> ?group:int -> ?devname:string -> unit -> Unix.file_descr * string
(** [opentun ~pi ~persist ~user ~group ~devname ()] will create a TUN
    interface. If [devname] is specified, or if [devname] specify an
    unexistant device, a new device will be created, otherwise, the
    interface [devname] will be opened. [no_pi] is to indicate if you
    want packet information associated with your frames (tap) or
    packets (tun) (defaults to no information). [persist] will set the
    device persistent with permissions set to [user] and [group] if
    supported by your OS (currently MacOSX does not support it). The
    return value is a pair consisting of a fd opened on the freshly
    created interface, and its name as will be displayed by command
    [ifconfig] for example. *)

val opentap : ?pi:bool -> ?persist:bool -> ?user:int
  -> ?group:int -> ?devname:string -> unit -> Unix.file_descr * string
(** Like [opentun], but open TAP interfaces instead of TUN ones. *)

val closetun : string -> unit
(** [closetun devname kind] will destroy [devname], if it exists. *)

val closetap : string -> unit
(** Like [closetun], but for TAP interfaces. *)

val get_ifnamsiz : unit -> int
(** [get_ifnamsiz ()] is the value of the constant IFNAMSIZ,
    defined in <net/if.h>. Useful for allocating buffers that contain
    interface names. *)

val get_macaddr : string -> Macaddr.t
(** [get_hwaddr devname] is the MAC address of interface
    [devname], as a raw string (not hexa). *)

val set_ipv4 : ?netmask:Ipaddr.V4.Prefix.t -> string -> Ipaddr.V4.t -> unit
(** [set_ipv4 ~netmask dev ipaddr] assigns an [ipaddr] to interface
    [dev], with associated netmask [netmask] if specified. If
    unspecified, the kernel will assign a default netmask
    automatically. *)

val set_up_and_running : string -> unit
(** [set_up_and_running devname] sets interface [devname] up and
    running. Note that when using the [set_ipv4] function, the
    interface will automatically be set up and running. *)

val getifaddrs : unit ->
  (string * [ `V4 of Ipaddr.V4.t * Ipaddr.V4.Prefix.t
            | `V6 of Ipaddr.V6.t * Ipaddr.V6.Prefix.t ]) list
(** [getifaddrs ()] is the list that associates interface names with
    IP addresses and prefix. Only interfaces that have an IP address
    assigned are returned. *)

val getifaddrs_v4 : unit -> (string * (Ipaddr.V4.t * Ipaddr.V4.Prefix.t)) list
(** Same as [getifaddrs] but only return interfaces that have an IPv4
    assigned. *)

val getifaddrs_v6 : unit -> (string * (Ipaddr.V6.t * Ipaddr.V6.Prefix.t)) list
(** Same as [getifaddrs] but only return interfaces that have an IPv6
    assigned. *)

val addrs_of_ifname : string ->
  [ `V4 of Ipaddr.V4.t * Ipaddr.V4.Prefix.t
  | `V6 of Ipaddr.V6.t * Ipaddr.V6.Prefix.t ] list
(** [addrs_of_ifname ifname] is the list of IP addresses and their
    prefixes associated to interface [ifname]. *)

val v4_of_ifname : string -> (Ipaddr.V4.t * Ipaddr.V4.Prefix.t) list
(** [v4_of_ifname ifname] is the list of IPv4 addresses and their
    prefixes associated to interface [ifname]. *)

val v6_of_ifname : string -> (Ipaddr.V6.t * Ipaddr.V6.Prefix.t) list
(** [v6_of_ifname ifname] is the list of IPv6 addresses and their
    prefixes associated to interface [ifname]. *)
