(* We rebind all the various [return]s because the use of the [Monad.Make] functor
   causes the compiler to not inline [return], and hence makes it impossible to
   statically allocate constants like [return ()].  By rebinding [return] as
   [Deferred0.return], the compiler can see that:

   {[
     return a = { Ivar.Immutable. cell = Full a } ]}

   And hence, if [a] is constant, then the return is constant and can be statically
   allocated.  When compiling with flambda, the compiler inlines [return] and this manual
   rebinding would not help; we've decided to do it anyway so that non-flambda builds
   get the optimization. *)
