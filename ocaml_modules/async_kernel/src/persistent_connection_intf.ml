  (** [create ~server_name ~on_event ~retry_delay get_address] returns a persistent
      connection to a server whose host and port are obtained via [get_address] every
      time we try to connect.  For example, [get_address] might look up a server's host
      and port in catalog at a particular path to which multiple redundant copies of a
      service are publishing their location.  If one copy dies, we get the address of the
      another one when looking up the address afterwards.

      All connection events (see the type above) are passed to the [on_event] callback, if
      given.  When this callback becomes determined, we move on to the next step in our
      connection attempt (e.g. we won't actually attempt to connect until
      [on_event Attempting_to_connect] is finished).  Note that [on_event Disconnected]
      will only be called once [on_event (Connected conn)] finishes even if the connection
      goes down during that callback.

      [`Failed_to_connect error] and [`Obtained_address addr] events are only reported if
      they are distinct from the most recent event of the same type that has taken place
      since the most recent [`Attempting_to_connect] event.

      Connection is retried after [Time.Span.randomize ~percent:(Percent.of_mult 0.3)
      (retry_delay ())]. The default for [retry_delay] is [const (sec 10.)]. Note that
      what this retry delay actually throttles is the delay between two connection
      attempts, so when a long-lived connection dies, connection is usually immediately
      retried, and if that failed, wait for another retry delay and retry. *)

  (** [connected] returns the first available connection from the time it is called.  When
      currently connected, the returned deferred is already determined.  If [closed] has
      been called, then the returned deferred is never determined. *)

  (** The current connection, if any. *)
  val current_connection : t -> conn option

  (** [close t] closes the current connection and stops it from trying to reconnect.
      After the deferred it returns becomes determined, the last connection has been
      closed and no others will be attempted.

      Note: no [close] calls are ever generated internally in response to the connection
      being closed by the other side.
