(** [general hashable f] returns a memoized version of [f], where the results are stored
    in a hash table indexed according to [hashable].  If [f a] asynchronously raises, then
    the error is stored in the hash table and is reraised when [a] is demanded.

    Unlike [Core_kernel.Memo.general], this [general] does not support
    [cache_size_bound] due to complexities of asynchrony -- even when one has a deferred
    return by the memoized function, there still may be asynchronous jobs working to
    determine it.

    Unlike [Core_kernel.Memo.general], this [general] takes a required [Hashable]
    module argument, to avoid unintentional use of polymorphic comparison. *)
