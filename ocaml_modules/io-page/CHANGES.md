## v2.1.0 (2019-02-07)
* Port to Dune and configurator (@avsm)
* Upgrade opam metadata to 2.0 (@avsm)

## 2.0.1 (2017-11-04):
* Fix build with OCaml 4.06 (and -safe-string)

## 2.0.0 (2017-06-14):
* Split into 3 opam packages
  - io-page: the common definitions
  - io-page-unix: the Unix stubs
  - io-page-xen: the Xen stubs
- Add a modern Docker-based travis configuration
- Add the ability to get a unique handle of an `Io_page`

## 1.6.1 (2016-06-13):
* Fix crash on Win32 when the GC calls the wrong `free` function (#31 from @djs55)
* Add a LICENSE file (#32 from @djs55)

## 1.6.0 (2016-03-03):
* Add support for Win32

## 1.5.1 (2015-03-18):
* Avoid cyclic dependency with `mirage-xen` (#21, patch from @hannesm)

## 1.5.0 (2015-03-16):
* Fix equallity of io-pages (#17, patch from @hannesm)
* Import C stubs from mirage-platform (#18, patch from @hannesm)

## 1.4.0 (2015-01-28):
* Add `of_cstruct_exn` as a safe way to turn a Cstruct back into an `Io_page.t`.
* Expose `page_size` constant in interface.

## 1.3.0 (2015-01-26):
* Make `Io_page.t` type private. Otherwise, any old array of bytes
  can be used as an `Io_page.t`. (#14)
* Switch to using the `Bytes` module instead of `String`.

## 1.2.0 (2014-11-21):
* Add `Io_page.get_buf` which allocates an Io_page
  and immediately turns it into a Cstruct that spans the
  entire page.
* Improve ocamldoc for exported functions.
* Add OPAM 1.2 file for easier local pinning workflow.

## 1.1.1 (2014-02-15):
* Improve portability on *BSD by not including `malloc.h` and
  just using `stdlib.h` instead.

## 1.1.0 (2014-01-30):
* Do not depend directly on the mirage-types signature to help
  break a circular dependency.  The `portable` test still exists
  to check against when changing anything.

## 1.0.0 (2014-01-16):
* Refactor the library into one pure-OCaml library (`io-page`)
  library and the Unix C-bindings (`io-page.unix`).

## 0.9.9 (2013-12-07):
* Add Travis CI scripts.
* Switch to an OASIS build system to fix META and C bindings.

## 0.1.0 (2013-12-02):
* Initial public release, based on mirage/mirage-platform#0.9.8
