(* The high-level interface creates one counter per event channel port.
   Every time the system receives a notification it increments the counter.
   Threads which have blocked elsewhere call 'after' which blocks until
   the stored counter is greater than the value they have already -- so
   if an event comes in between calls then it will not be lost.

   In the high-level interface it's almost impossible to miss an event.
   The only way you can miss is if you block while your port's counter
   wraps. Arguably if you have failed to notice 2bn (32-bit) wakeups then
   you have bigger problems. *)
