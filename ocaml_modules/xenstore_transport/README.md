ocaml-xenstore-clients
======================

Unix client tools for accessing xenstore.

So far we have:
  1. a CLI for interacting with xenstore
  2. a benchmarking tool for measuring performance
  3. a suite of "unit tests" for verifying functional correctness
  4. libraries for Unix applications to connect to xenstore
