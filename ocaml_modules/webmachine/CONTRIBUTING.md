# Goals

[erlang]: https://github.com/webmachine/webmachine
[lwt]: https://ocsigen.org/lwt
[async]: https://github.com/janestreet/async

The goals of this project are the following:

* implement a faithful port of the [Erlang webmachine project][erlang];
* support [lwt][] and [async][] equally well; and
* impose as few dependencies on the user as possible.

## Commits and Pull Requests

[commit-msg]: http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html

The best way to get a pull request accepted is for it to directly serve the
goals of the project, while being simple and straightforward for project
maintainers to evalute it in terms of functionality and maintainability. In
service to the these criteria, pull request and commit messages should clearly
describe what they include and why. Generally speaking, follow the guidelines
of [this blog post][commit-msg] when composing commit messages. Pull requests
should pass existing tests and include additional tests when appropriate. The
code should be clear rather than clever (two-liners over one-liners), and
documented when the code can't speak for itself.

If a part of the existing code is not relevant to the topic of your pull
request, please refrain from modifying it (see below). If a change or feature
will have a large effect on the codebase, bring it up for discussion in an
issue. To quote a tweet:

> People of github,
>
> 1. Raise issue
> 2. Discuss, propose solution
> 3. Implement

> Sometimes it's ok to skip a step, but pls don't change the order.

## Releases

Releases will be prepared and performed by maintainers. Please do not include
any changes related to release management in your contributions.

## Whitespace

Two space indentation. No tabs. No trailing whitespace. If you find any
violations in or around code that you need to modify, feel free to fix it. If
you find violations in unrelated code, just leave it there.

## Updating Dependencies

In the event that a contribution requires changes to the project's
dependencies, here's how you should incorporate those changes into the
build/release process:

[jbuild]: https://github.com/inhabitedtype/ocaml-webmachine/tree/master/lib/jbuild
[OPAM]: http://http://opam.ocaml.org/

1. Modify the [`jbuild`][jbuild] file to reflect changed dependencies; and
2. Update `opam/opam` to reflect the changes made in the `jbuild` file.

Try to include these changes in a separate commit. That's not always possible,
so don't sweat it too much if you can't.
