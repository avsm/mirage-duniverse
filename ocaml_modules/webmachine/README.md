# ocaml-webmachine

ocaml-webmachine is a layer on top of [cohttp][] that implements a
state-machine-based HTTP request processor. It's particularly well-suited for
writing RESTful APIs. As the name suggests, this is an OCaml port of the
[webmachine][] project.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/inhabitedtype/ocaml-webmachine.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/inhabitedtype/ocaml-webmachine)

## Installation

Install the library and its depenencies via [OPAM][opam]:

[opam]: http://opam.ocaml.org/

```bash
opam install webmachine
```

## Getting Started

webmachine implements [this decision diagram][diagram] to determine how an HTTP
request should be handled. This includes validation, authentication, content
negotiation, and caching. A resource specifies the decision that should be made
at each node in the diagram by defining the appropriate method in a `resource`
subclass. The correspondence is suggested by the name of the method for now.
This will be better-documented in the future.

### Examples

To build the examples in the [`examples/`][examples_dir] subdirectory:

```bash
jbuilder build _build/default/examples/hello_lwt.exe
jbuilder build _build/default/examples/crud_lwt.exe
jbuilder build _build/default/examples/hello_async.exe
```

## Development

To install development dependencies, pin the package from the root of the
repository:

```bash
opam pin add -n webmachine .
opam install --deps-only webmachine
```

After this, you may install a development version of the library using the
install command as usual.

For building and running the tests during development, you will need to install
the `oUnit` package and run tests:

```bash
opam install oUnit
jbuilder runtest
```
