Introduction
============

ATD stands for Adjustable Type Definitions.

.. code-block:: ocaml

  (* This is a sample ATD file *)

  type profile = {
    id : string;
    email : string;
    ~email_validated : bool;
    name : string;
    ?real_name : string option;
    ~about_me : string list;
    ?gender : gender option;
    ?date_of_birth : date option;
  }

  type gender = [ Female | Male ]

  type date = {
    year : int;
    month : int;
    day : int;
  }

ATD is a language for defining data types across multiple programming languages
and multiple data formats. That's it.

We provide an OCaml library that provides a parser and a collection of tools
that make it easy to write data validators and code generators based on ATD
definitions.

Unlike big frameworks that provide everything in one monolithic package, we
split the problem of data exchange into logical modules and ATD is one of them.
In particular, we acknowledge that the following pieces have little in common
and should be defined and implemented separately:


* data type specifications
* transport protocols
* serialization formats

Ideally we want just one single language for defining data types and it should
accomodate all programming languages and data formats. ATD can play this role,
but its OCaml implementation makes it particularly easy to translate ATD
specifications into other interface definition languages if needed.

It is however much harder to imagine that a single transport protocol and a
single serialization format would ever become the only ones used. A reader from
the future might wonder why we are even considering defining a transport
protocol and a serialization format together. This has been a widespread
practice at least until the beginning of the 21st century (ONC RPC, ICE, Thrift,
etc.). For mysterious reasons, people somehow became convinced that calls to
remote services should be made to mimic internal function calls, pretending that
nothing really bad could happen on the way between the caller and the remote
service. Well, I don't let my 3-old daughter go to school by herself because the
definition of the external world is precisely that it is unsafe.

Data input is by definition unsafe. A program whose internal data is corrupted
should abort but a failed attempt to read external data should not cause a
program to abort. On the contrary, a program should be very resistent to all
forms of data corruption and attacks and provide the best diagnosis possible
when problems with external data occur.

Because data exchange is critical and involves multiple partners, we depart from
magic programming language-centric or company-centric approaches. We define ATD,
a data type definition language designed for maximum expressivity, compatibility
across languages and static type checking of programs using such data.

Scope
-----

ATD offers a core syntax for type definitions, i.e. an idealized view of the
structure of data. Types are mapped to each programming language or data format
using language-specific conventions. Annotations can complete the type
definitions in order to specify options for a particular language. Annotations
are placed in angle brackets after the element they refer to:

.. code-block:: ocaml

  type profile = {
    id : int <ocaml repr="int64">;
      (*
        An int here will map to an OCaml int64 instead of
        OCaml's default int type.
        Other languages than OCaml will use their default int type.
      *)

    age : int;
      (* No annotation here, the default int type will be used. *)
  }

ATD supports:

* the following atomic types: bool, int, float, string and unit;
* built-in list and option types;
* records aka structs with a syntax for optional fields with or
  without default;
* tuples;
* sum types aka variant types, algebraic data types or tagged unions;
* parametrized types;
* inheritance for both records and sum types;
* abstract types;
* arbitrary annotations.


ATD by design does not support:

* function types, function signatures or method signatures;
* a syntax to represent values;
* a syntax for submodules.

Language overview
-----------------

ATD was strongly inspired by the type system of ML and OCaml. Such a
type system allows static type checking and type inference, properties
which contribute to the safety and conciseness of the language.

Unlike mainstream languages like Java, C++, C# or Python to name a
few, languages such as Haskell or OCaml offer sum types,
also known as algebraic data types or variant types. These allow to
specify that an object is of one kind or another without ever
performing dynamic casts.

.. code-block:: ocaml

  (* Example of a sum type in ATD. The vertical bar reads `or'. *)
  type shape = [
      Square of float               (* argument: side length *)
    | Rectangle of (float * float)  (* argument: width and height *)
    | Circle of float               (* argument: radius *)
    | Dot                           (* no argument *)
  ]

A notable example of sum types is the predefined option type.
An object of an option type contains either one value of a given type
or nothing. We could define our own `int_option` type as follows:

.. code-block:: ocaml

  type int_option = [ None | Some of int ]

ATD supports parametrized types also known as generics in Java or
templates in C++.  We could define our own generic option type as
follows:

.. code-block:: ocaml

  type 'a opt = [ None | Some of 'a ]
    (* 'a denotes a type parameter. *)

  type opt_int = int opt
    (* equivalent to int_option defined in the previous example *)

  type opt_string = string opt
    (* same with string instead of int *)

In practice we shall use the predefined option type.
The option type is fundamentally different from nullable objects since
the latter don't allow values that would have type `'a option option`.

ATD also support product types. They come in two forms: tuples and
records:

.. code-block:: ocaml

  type tuple_example = (string * int)

  type record_example = {
    name : string;
    age : int;
  }

Although tuples in theory are not more expressive than records, they are much
more concise and languages that support them natively usually do not require
type definitions.

Finally, ATD supports multiple inheritance which is a simple mechanism for
adding fields to records or variants to sum types:

.. code-block:: ocaml

  type builtin_color = [
      Red | Green | Blue | Yellow
    | Purple | Black | White
  ]

  type rgb = (float * float * float)
  type cmyk = (float * float * float * float)

  (* Inheritance of variants *)
  type color = [
      inherit builtin_color
    | Rgb of rgb
    | Cmyk of cmyk
  ]

.. code-block:: ocaml

  type basic_profile = {
    id : string;
    name : string;
  }

  (* Inheritance of record fields *)
  type full_profile = {
    inherit basic_profile;
    date_of_birth : (int * int * int) option;
    street_address1 : string option;
    street_address2 : string option;
    city : string option;
    zip_code : string option;
    state : string option;
  }


Editing and validating ATD files
--------------------------------

The extension for ATD files is ``.atd``. Editing ATD files is best achieved
using an OCaml-friendly editor since the ATD syntax is vastly compatible with
OCaml and uses a subset of OCaml's keywords.

Emacs users can use caml-mode or tuareg-mode to edit ATD files. Adding the
following line to the ``~/.emacs`` file will automatically use tuareg-mode when
opening a file with a ``.atd`` extension:

.. code-block:: lisp

  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.atd\\'" . tuareg-mode))

The syntax of an ATD file can be checked with the program ``atdcat`` provided with
the OCaml library ``atd``. ``atdcat`` pretty-prints its input data, optionally after
some transformations such as monomorphization or inheritance. Here is the output
of ``atdcat -help``:

::

  Usage: atdcat FILE
    -x 
            make type expressions monomorphic
    -xk 
            keep parametrized type definitions and imply -x.
            Default is to return only monomorphic type definitions
    -xd 
            debug mode implying -x
    -i 
            expand all `inherit' statements
    -if 
            expand `inherit' statements in records
    -iv 
            expand `inherit' statements in sum types
    -ml <name>
            output the ocaml code of the ATD abstract syntax tree
    -html-doc 
            replace directly <doc html="..."> by (*html ... *)
            or replace <doc text="..."> by (*html ... *)
            where the contents are formatted as HTML
            using <p>, <code> and <pre>.
            This is suitable input for "caml2html -ext html:cat"
            which converts ATD files into HTML.
    -strip NAME1[,NAME2,...]
            remove all annotations of the form <NAME1 ...>,
            <NAME2 ...>, etc.
    -strip-all 
            remove all annotations
    -version 
            print the version of atd and exit
    -help  Display this list of options
    --help  Display this list of options

ATD language
============

This is a precise description of the syntax of the ATD language, not a
tutorial.

Notations
----------

Lexical and grammatical rules are expressed using a BNF-like syntax.
Graphical terminal symbols use `unquoted strings in typewriter font`.
Non-graphical characters use their official uppercase ASCII name such
as LF for the newline character or SPACE for the space character.
Non-terminal symbols use the regular font and link to their
definition.  Parentheses are used for grouping.

The following postfix operators are used to specify repeats:

------ ---------------------------------
x*     0, 1 or more occurrences of x
x?     0 or 1 occurrence of x
x+     1 or more occurrences of x
------ ---------------------------------


Lexical rules
-------------

ATD does not enforce a particular character encoding other than ASCII
compatibility. Non-ASCII text and data found in annotations and
in comments may contain arbitrary bytes in the non-ASCII range 128-255
without escaping. The UTF-8 encoding is however strongly recommended
for all text. The use of hexadecimal or decimal escape sequences is
recommended for binary data.

An ATD lexer splits its input into a stream of tokens,
discarding whitespace and comments.

Predefined type names
---------------------

The following types are considered predefined and may not be
redefined.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Type name          Intended use
------------------ -----------------------------------------------------------
`unit`             Type of just one value, useful with parametrized types

`bool`             Boolean

`int`              Integer

`float`            Floating-point number

`string`           Sequence of bytes or characters

`'a option`        Container of zero or one element of type `'a`.
                   See also `'a nullable`.

`'a list`          Collection or sequence of elements of type `'a`

`'a nullable`      Extend type `'a` with an extra conventional value,
                   typically called "null". The operation is idempotent,
                   i.e. `'a nullable` is equivalent to
                   `'a nullable nullable`.

`'a shared`        Values of type `'a` for which sharing must be preserved

`'a wrap`          Values on which a custom, reversible transformation
                   may be applied, as specified by
                   language-specific annotations.

`abstract`         Type defined elsewhere
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Shared values
-------------

ATD supports a special type $x$ `shared` where $x$ can be
any monomorphic type expression.
It allows notably to represent cyclic values and to enforce that cycles
are preserved during transformations such as serialization.

```ocaml
(* Example of a simple graph type *)
type shared_node = node shared (* sharing point *)
type graph = shared_node list
type node = {
  label : string;
  neighbors : shared_node list;
}
```

Two shared values that are physically identical must remain physically
identical after any translation from one data format to another.

Each occurrence of a `shared` type expression in the ATD
source definition defines its own sharing point.
Therefore the following attempt at defining a graph type will not
preserve cycles because two sharing points are defined:

.. code-block:: ocaml

  (* Incorrect definition of a graph type *)
  type node = {
    label : string;
    neighbors : node shared (* sharing point 1 *) list;
  }

  (* Second occurrence of "shared", won't preserve cycles! *)
  type graph = node shared (* sharing point 2 *) list

There is actually a way of having multiple ``shared`` type expressions using the
same sharing point but this feature is designed for code generators and should
not be used in handwritten ATD definitions. The technique consists in providing
an annotation of the form ``<share id=`_x_`>`` where _x_ is any string
identifying the sharing point. The graph example can be rewritten correctly as:

.. code-block:: ocaml

  type node = {
    label : string;
    neighbors : node shared <share id="1"> list;
  }

  type graph = node shared <share id="1"> list
