                   Installation instructions for atd


Requirements:

- Objective Caml (>= 3.11 is fine, earlier versions are probably fine too)
- GNU make
- Findlib (`ocamlfind' command)
- menhir http://pauillac.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/
- easy-format http://martin.jambon.free.fr/easy-format.html


GODI makes the installation process straightforward,
although other package managers can be equally convenient.


Manual installation is done using:

make           # or `make all' for the bytecode-only version

make install   # or `make BINDIR=/foo/bin install' for installing executables
               # in a place other than the guessed default.


Uninstallation:

make uninstall
