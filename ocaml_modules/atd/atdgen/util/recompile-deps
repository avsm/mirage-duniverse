# Script for working with development versions of atdgen's dependencies.
# All git repositories (atd, atdgen, etc.) must exist in the same directory.

# Usage (from within atdgen/): . util/recompile-deps

# This script is meant to be sourced from the atdgen directory.
# It sets the OCAMLPATH variable such that the development versions
# of atdgen's dependencies are found first when compiling.
