                         Example using atdgen
                         ====================


This simple but standalone example illustrates the use of atdgen to
manage a backward-compatible change of data format.

The old data format is defined in `format_v1.atd'.  The newer data
format is defined in `format_v2.atd'.  It is a record type from which
one field was removed and another field was added.

The program `upgrade_demo' demonstrates the use of atdgen in general
and how to make a data format evolve without losing compatibility
with legacy data files or services.

1.  Atdgen must be installed properly
2.  Run `make'
3.  Inspect the files starting with example.sh
