(* execute function supressing compactions. the doc says:
   mutable max_overhead : int;
   Heap compaction is triggered when the estimated amount of "wasted" memory
   is more than max_overhead percent of the amount of live data.
   If max_overhead is set to 0, heap compaction is triggered at the end of each
   major GC cycle (this setting is intended for testing purposes only).
   If max_overhead >= 1000000, compaction is never triggered.
   Default: 500. *)

     struct are mutable, so it does not make much sense to save it *)
