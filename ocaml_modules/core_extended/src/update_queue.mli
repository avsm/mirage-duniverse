(** A ['state t] keeps track of updates of type ['state -> 'state] queued to it and runs
    them sequentially.

    This has the primary feature that if an update itself schedules another update, that
    other update will be run after the first update has finished.

    For example, consider the code:

    {[let x = create ~init:1 () in
    enqueue_update x (fun x ->
    enqueue_update (fun x -> x + 1);
    x + 1)]}

    At the end, [x]'s state will be 2, as you would expect.  However, suppose you did
    this with an [int ref]:

    {[let x = ref 1 in
    let update_x f = x := f !x in
    update_x (fun x ->
      update_x (fun x -> x + 1);
      x + 1
    )]}

    At the end of this, [!x] would be 1.

    Another feature is that the initial value does not have to be specified at creation.
    If it is not, enqueued updates will be kept around until an initial value is specified
    with [init].

   will not be garbage-collected at least as long as the input [t] is not garbage-collected. *)
