(** Binary search.

    (f i) returns an integer and should be monotonic.
    f should have values for all i in [low,high], inclusive.

    if \E i \in [low,high] such that (f i) = 0,
    then such an i is returned.
    Otherwise, i is returned such that (f i > 0) and (f (i-1) < 0).
    Unless it's all > 0 or all < 0.
    If it's all > 0, then the first i is returned.
    If it's all < 0, then returns None
