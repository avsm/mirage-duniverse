(** [collate s1 s2] sorts string in an order that's usaully more suited for human
    consumption by treating ints specially, e.g. it will output:
    [["rfc1.txt";"rfc822.txt";"rfc2086.txt"]].

    It works by splitting the strings in numerical and non-numerical chunks and comparing
    chunks two by two from left to right (and starting on a non numerical chunk):

    - Non_numerical chunks are compared using lexicographical ordering.
    - Numerical chunks are compared based on the values of the represented ints
      and the number of trailing zeros.

    It is a total order. *)
val collate : string -> string -> int

(**
   [unescaped s] is the inverse operation of [escaped]: it takes a string where
   all the special characters are escaped following the lexical convention of
   OCaml and returns an unescaped copy.
   The [strict] switch is on by default and makes the function treat illegal
   backslashes as errors.
   When [strict] is [false] every illegal backslash except escaped numeral
   greater than [255] is copied literally. The aforementioned numerals still
   raise errors. This mimics the behaviour of the ocaml lexer.
*)
val unescaped : ?strict:bool -> string -> string

(**
   Same as [unescaped] but instead of raising [Failure _] returns an error
   message with the position in the string in case of failure.
*)
val unescaped_res : ?strict:bool -> string -> (string,(int*string)) Result.t

(** [squeeze str] reduces all sequences of spaces, newlines, tables, and
 * carriage returns to single spaces.
 *)
val squeeze : string -> string

(** Use Core.String.is_substring instead of this function.
    This wrapper is here (for now) to maintain bug compatibility. *)
val is_substring_deprecated : substring:string -> string -> bool

(** [pad_left ~char s len]
    Returns [s] padded to the length [len] by adding characters [char] to the
    left of the string. If s is already longer than [len] it is returned unchanged.
*)
val pad_left : ?char:char -> string -> int -> string
val pad_right : ?char:char -> string -> int -> string

(**deprecated in favour of word_wrap *)
val line_break: len:int -> string -> string list

(**
   [word_wrap ~soft_limit s]

   Wraps the string so that it fits the length [soft_limit]. It doesn't break
   words unless we go over [hard_limit].

   if [nl] is passed it is inserted instead of the normal newline character.
*)
val word_wrap:
  ?trailing_nl:bool
  -> ?soft_limit:int
  -> ?hard_limit:int
  -> ?nl:string
  -> string
  -> string

(** Gives the Levenshtein distance between 2 strings, which is the number of insertions,
    deletions, and substitutions necessary to turn either string into the other. With the
    [transpose] argument, it alsos considers transpositions (Damerau-Levenshtein
    distance). *)
val edit_distance : ?transpose : unit -> string -> string -> int
