   An Ecma escape sequence is two characters separated by one or two optional
   numbers.

   This reads Ecma sequences from the stdin; it doesn't however read the escape
   character ["\027"]. It is based on specifications and reverse engineering...

  Does not handle all the bells and whistles of Ecma-48 because we only need
  to handle what the keyboard can reasonably output.
