(** MirageOS Signatures.

    This module defines the basic signatures that functor parameters
    should implement in MirageOS to be portable.

    {2 General conventions}

    {ul
    {- errors which application programmers are expected to handle
       (e.g. connection refused or end of file) are encoded as result types
       where [Ok x] means the operation was succesful and returns [x] and
       where [Error e] means the operation has failed with error [e].
       The error [e] uses the {!Rresult.R.msg} type for the most general
       error message, and possibly more specific ones depending on the interface. }
    {- errors which represent programming errors such as assertion failures
       or illegal arguments are encoded as exceptions. The application may
       attempt to catch exceptions and recover or simply let the exception
       propagate and crash the application. If the application crashes then
       the runtime system should output diagnostics and abort. }
    {- operations which perform I/O return values of [type +'a io] which
       allow the application to either wait for the I/O to be completed or
       leave it running asynchronously. If the I/O completes with an error
       then the operation may have completely failed, partially succeeded
       or even completely succeeded (e.g. it may only be a confirmation
       message in a network protocol which was missed): see individual API
       descriptions for details. }
