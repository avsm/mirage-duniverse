(** [next_event t ~event ~stop ~after ()] waits for the time of the next event matching
    [event] in [t] starting at time [after].  At that time, the resulting deferred is
    determined and filled with the time of the event.

    If [stop] becomes determined before the next event, the resulting deferred is never
    filled and the computation to find the next event stops.  If the caller intends to
    never use the returned deferred, stop should be filled or the background computation
    will continue to keep the deferred alive until the event occurs.

    This function is a good choice for handling a single event during the run of a
    program, like scheduling shutdown.  If the intention is to follow along with all
    events in a schedule, it is preferable to call [to_pipe] or [to_endless_sequence]
    (in the non-async module). *)

(** [every_enter_without_pushback t ~start ~stop ~continue_on_error
    ~start_in_range_is_enter f] calls [f] for each contiguous block of time in [t]
    starting at [start] and continuing until [stop] becomes determined.

    For each block of time with start time [enter] and end time [leave_time], [f] is
    called with [f ~enter ~leave], where [leave] is a deferred that becomes determined at
    [leave_time] with the value [leave_time].

    If [includes t start && start_in_range_is_enter], then [f] will be called as soon as
    possible after [start] with [enter = start].  Otherwise, [f] will not be called for
    any block of time that includes [start].

    If [continue_on_error = false] and [f] (or any async job started by [f]) raises an
    error, [f] will no longer be called, and all undetermined [leave] deferreds will
    remain unfulfilled.

    If [stop] is fulfilled then no further calls to [f] will be made and all undetermined
    [leave] deferreds will remain unfulfilled. *)

(** [every_tag_change t f] calls [f] for each contiguous block of time in [t] where the
    set of tags in effect remains stable (according to tag_equal).

    Moving from a range where the schedule is not in effect to one where it is in effect
    with no tags is considered a tag change.

    For each block of time tagged with [tags] and start time [enter] and end time
    [leave_time], [f] is called with [f ~tags ~enter ~leave], where [leave] is a deferred
    that becomes determined at [leave_time] with the value [leave_time].
