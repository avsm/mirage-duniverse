      Once submitted, it is not possible to cancel a request and there
      is no timeout.

      The operation may fail with:

      {ul

      {- [`Unimplemented]: the operation has not been implemented, no
      data has been written.}
      {- [`Is_read_only]: the device is read-only, no data has been
      written.}
      {- [`Disconnected]: the device has been disconnected at
        application request, an unknown amount of data has been
        written.}
      }

      Each of [buffers] must be a whole number of sectors in
      length. The list of buffers can be of any length.

      The data will not be copied, so the supplied buffers must not be
      re-used until the IO operation completes. *)
