## v0.11.1

- Update for AST 4.06

## v0.11

- Depend on ppxlib instead of (now deprecated) ppx\_core, ppx\_driver and
  ppx\_metaquot.

## 113.43.00

- Implemented `Variants.to_rank`.

  Somewhat surprisingly, the preprocessor didn't reject variant
  inclusion despite what the documentation says, but instead would
  consider that they use one rank (??). Also the generated signature
  didn't match the generated code in that case. Removed completely the
  support for polymorphic variant inclusion.

## 113.24.00

- The `iter` function generated by ppx\_variants\_conv and ppx\_fields\_conv allowed
  one to give function which returned values of arbitrary types as iter function.
  This feature constraint these functions to return unit.

  N.B. the signature generated by the use of `@@deriving variants` (resp. fields)
  in interface already constrained the type to unit.

- Update to follow `Type_conv` evolution.
