(** The Functoria DSL.

    The Functoria DSL allows users to describe how to create portable
    and flexible applications. It allows to pass application
    parameters easily using command-line arguments either at
    configure-time or at runtime.

    Users of the Functoria DSL composes their application by defining
    a list of {{!foreign}module} implementations, specify the
    command-line {!keys} that are required and {{!combinators}combine}
    all of them together using
    {{:http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0956796807006326}applicative}
    operators.

    The DSL expression is then compiled into an {{!app}application
    builder}, which will, once evaluated, produced the final portable
    and flexible application.

(** The type for values representing module types. *)

  | Function: 'b typ * 'c typ -> ('b -> 'c) typ

val typ: 'a -> 'a typ
(** [type t] is a value representing the module type [t]. *)

val (@->): 'a typ -> 'b typ -> ('a -> 'b) typ
(** Construct a functor type from a type and an existing functor
    type. This corresponds to prepending a parameter to the list of
    functor parameters. For example:

    {[ kv_ro @-> ip @-> kv_ro ]}

    This describes a functor type that accepts two arguments -- a
    [kv_ro] and an [ip] device -- and returns a [kv_ro].
*)

type job
(** Type for job values. *)

val job: job typ
(** [job] is the signature for user's application main module. *)

type 'a impl
(** The type for values representing module implementations. *)

val ($): ('a -> 'b) impl -> 'a impl -> 'b impl
(** [m $ a] applies the functor [m] to the module [a]. *)

(** The type for abstract implementations. *)
type abstract_impl = Abstract: _ impl -> abstract_impl

val abstract: _ impl -> abstract_impl
(** [abstract t] is [t] but with its type variable abstracted. Useful
    for dependencies. *)

(** {1:keys Keys} *)

type key = Functoria_key.t
(** The type for command-line keys. See {!Functoria_key.t}. *)

type context = Functoria_key.context
(** The type for keys' parsing context. See {!Functoria_key.context}. *)

type 'a value = 'a Functoria_key.value
(** The type for values parsed from the command-line. See
    {!Functoria_key.value}. *)

val if_impl: bool value -> 'a impl -> 'a impl -> 'a impl
(** [if_impl v impl1 impl2] is [impl1] if [v] is resolved to true and
    [impl2] otherwise. *)

val match_impl: 'b value -> default:'a impl -> ('b * 'a impl) list ->  'a impl
(** [match_impl v cases ~default] chooses the implementation amongst
    [cases] by matching the [v]'s value. [default] is chosen if no
    value matches. *)

  with type 'a Arg.converter = 'a Functoria_key.Arg.converter

(** The signature for run-time and configure-time command-line

(** {1:pkg Package dependencies}

    For specifying opam package dependencies, the type {!package} is used.  It
    consists of the opam package name, the ocamlfind names, and optional lower
    and upper bounds.  The version constraints are merged with other modules.
*)

type package = private {
  opam : string ;
  pin : string option ;
  build : bool ;
  ocamlfind : Astring.String.Set.t ;
  min : string option ;
  max : string option
}
(** The type of a package *)

val package :
  ?build:bool ->
  ?sublibs:string list ->
  ?ocamlfind:string list ->
  ?min:string ->
  ?max:string ->
  ?pin:string ->
  string -> package
(** [package ~build ~sublibs ~ocamlfind ~min ~max ~pin opam] is a [package].  [Build]
    indicates a build-time dependency only, defaults to [false]. The ocamlfind
    name is by default the same as [opam], you can specify [~sublibs] to add
    additional sublibraries (e.g. [~sublibs:["mirage"] "foo"] will result in the
    findlib names [ ["foo"; "foo.mirage"] ].  In case the findlib name is
    disjoint (or empty), use [~ocamlfind].  Specifying both [~ocamlfind] and
    [~sublibs] leads to an invalid argument.  Version constraints are given as
    [min] (inclusive) and [max] (exclusive).  If [pin] is provided, a
    {{:https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Manual.html#opamfield-pin-depends}pin-depends}
    is generated. *)

(** {1:app Application Builder}

    Values of type {!impl} are tied to concrete module implementation
    with the {!foreign} construct. Module implementations of type
    {!job} can then be {{!Functoria_app.Make.register}registered} into
    an application builder. The builder is in charge if parsing the
    command-line arguments and of generating code for the final
    application. See {!Functoria_app} for details. *)

val foreign:
  ?packages:package list ->
  ?keys:key list ->
  ?deps:abstract_impl list ->
  string -> 'a typ -> 'a impl
(** [foreign name typ] is the module [name], having the module type
    [typ].

    {ul
    {- If [packages] is set, then the given packages are
       installed before compiling the current application.}
    {- If [keys] is set, use the given {{!Functoria_key.key}keys} to
       parse at configure and runtime the command-line arguments
       before calling [name.connect].}
    {- If [deps] is set, the given list of {{!abstract_impl}abstract}
       implementations is added as data-dependencies: they will be
       initialized before calling [name.connect]. }
    }

    step, see the {!configurable} class type and the {!class:foreign} class.

  val name: t -> string
  (** [name t] is the name of the application. *)

  (** [output t] is the name of [t]'s output. Derived from {!name} if
      not set. *)

  val with_output: t -> string -> t
  (** [with_output t o] is similar to [t] but with the output set to
      [Some o]. *)
