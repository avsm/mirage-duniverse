    state, does nothing and has no dependency. *)

(** The type for command-line arguments, similar to the usual

(** [keys a] is an implementation of {!Functoria.job} that holds the
    parsed command-line arguments. *)

(** [info] is a value representing {!info} module types. *)

    the information available at configure-time. The type of the
    generated value lives in the module [type_modname]: if not set, it
    is [Functoria_info]. The value is stored into a generated module
