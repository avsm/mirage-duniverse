(** A thread-safe pipe is a thread-safe interface to the write end of a normal
    [Async.Pipe].  {b All operations except for [create] must be called from threads
    outside Async}, while [create] can be called from inside or outside Async.

    For [Pipe] functions that return a [unit Deferred.t], the analog in [Thread_safe_pipe]
    blocks.

    For documentation of [wakeup_scheduler], see the {!Thread_safe} module. *)

(** The writer end of the pipe. *)
type 'a t [@@deriving sexp_of]

(** [create ()] returns a reader end, which must be used inside Async, and a writer end,
    which must be used outside Async.  [create] can be called inside or outside Async. *)
val create : unit -> 'a Pipe.Reader.t * 'a t

(** All the following functions must be called outside Async.  They behave as their
    counterpart in the {!Pipe} module. *)

(** [pushback writer] blocks the current thread until the pipe is empty or closed. *)

module Written_or_closed : sig
  type t = Written | Closed
end

(** Functions that write elements to the pipe take an [If_closed.t] argument to specify
    how to deal with the possibility that the pipe is closed.

    The alternatives are to [Raise] on a closed pipe, or [Return] a variant indicating
    whether the pipe is closed.  This allows lightweight syntax for calls that want to
    raise if the pipe is closed:

    {[
      write t a ~if_closed:Raise ]}

    It also allows lightweight syntax for calls that want to match on whether the pipe was
    closed:

    {[
      match write t a ~if_closed:Return with
      | Closed  -> ...
      | Written -> ... ]}

    Returning a variant is essential when one wants to distinguish a closed pipe from
    other errors.  Also, since pipe-writing functions acquire the Async lock, it would be
    incorrect (due to races) to check [is_closed] prior to the lock acquisition. *)
