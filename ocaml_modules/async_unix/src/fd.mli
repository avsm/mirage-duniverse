(** An [Fd.t] is a wrapper around a Unix file descriptor, with additional information
    about the kind of file descriptor and logic to ensure that we don't use a file
    descriptor that has been closed, or close a file descriptor that is in use.

    Since Async uses multiple threads to make read/write and other system calls on file
    descriptors, and Unix reuses descriptors after they are closed, Async has to be very
    careful that the file descriptor passed to a system call is referring to the file it
    intends, and not some other completely unrelated file that Unix has decided to assign
    to the same descriptor.

    Provided that one only accesses a file descriptor within the context of the functions
    below, [Fd] guarantees that the file descriptor will not have been closed/reused and
    will correspond to the same file that it did when the [Fd.t] was created:

    {v
      with_file_descr
      with_file_descr_deferred
      syscall
      syscall_exn
      syscall_result_exn
      syscall_in_thread
      syscall_in_thread_exn
    v}

    The [Fd] module keeps track of which of these functions are currently accessing the
    file descriptor, and ensures that any close happens after they complete.  Also, once
    close has been called, it refuses to provide further access to the file descriptor,
    either by returning a variant [`Already_closed] or by raising an exception.

    Some of the above functions take an optional [?nonblocking:bool] argument.  The
    default is [false], but if it is set to [true], then before supplying the underlying
    [file_descr], the [Fd] module will first call [Unix.set_nonblock file_descr], if it
    hasn't previously done so on that file descriptor.  This is intended to support making
    nonblocking system calls (e.g., connect, read, write) directly within Async, without
    releasing the OCaml lock or the Async lock, and without using another thread. *)

    We thought about using [fstat()] rather than requiring the user to supply the kind.
    But [fstat] can block, which would require putting this in a thread, which has some
    consequences, and it isn't clear that it gets us that much.  Also, [create] is mostly
    used within the Async implementation -- clients shouldn't need it unless they are
    mixing Async and non-Async code.

    If [avoid_nonblock_if_possible], then Async will treat the file descriptor as blocking
    if it can (more precisely, if it's not a bound socket). *)

    want to share a file descriptor between Async and non-Async code and want to avoid
    [EWOULDBLOCK] or [EAGAIN] being seen by the non-Async code, which would then cause a
    [Sys_blocked_io] exception.

  (** [close t] prevents further use of [t], and makes [shutdown()] and [close()] system
      calls on [t]'s underlying file descriptor according to the
      [file_descriptor_handling] argument and whether or not [t] is a socket, i.e., [kind
      t = Socket `Active]:

      {v
        | file_descriptor_handling                     | shutdown() | close() |

      The result of [close] becomes determined once the system calls complete.  It is OK
      to call [close] multiple times on the same [t]; calls subsequent to the initial call
      will have no effect, but will return the same deferred as the original call. *)
