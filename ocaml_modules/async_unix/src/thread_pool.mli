(** A thread pool is a set of OCaml threads used to do work, where each piece of work is
    simply a thunk.  One creates a thread pool, and then uses [add_work] to submit work to
    it.  Work is done first-come-first-served by available threads in the pool.  Any of
    the available threads in the pool could be used to do work submitted to the pool
    (except helper threads, see below).

    A thread pool starts with no threads.  As work is added, the thread pool creates new
    threads to do the work, up to the maximum number of allowed threads,
    [max_num_threads], supplied to [create].  Thread-pool threads never die.  They just
    get created up until [max_num_threads] is reached and then live forever, doing work.
    Each thread in the pool is in a loop, waiting for a piece of work, running the thunk,
    and then repeating.  It may be that all the threads in the pool are not doing
    anything, but in this case, the threads still exist, and are simply blocked waiting
    for work.

    Sometimes one wants work to run in a dedicated thread, e.g. some C libraries require
    this.  To do this, use [Helper_thread], see below.

    All of the functions exposed by this module are thread safe; they synchronize using a
    mutex on the thread pool.

    One must not call thread-pool functions from a GC finalizer, since a finalizer could
    run within a thread running a thread-pool function, which already holds the lock, and
    would therefore deadlock or error when attempting to re-acquire it.  This is
    accomplished elsewhere by using Async finalizers, which are run from ordinary Async
    jobs, and thus do not hold the thread-pool lock.

    One can control the priority of threads in the pool (in the sense of
    [Linux_ext.setpriority]).  Work added to the pool can optionally be given a priority,
    and the pool will set the priority of the thread that runs it for the duration of the
    work.  Helper threads can also be given a priority, which will be used for all work
    run by the helper thread, unless the work has an overriding priority.  The thread pool
    has a "default" priority that will be used for all work and helper threads that have
    no specified priority.  The default is simply the priority in effect when [create] is
    called.

    Behavior is unspecified if work calls [setpriority] directly. *)

    [Linux_ext.pr_set_name]) to [name] and the priority of the thread will be set
    to [priority].

(** [finished_with_helper_thread t helper_thread] informs thread pool [t] that no future
    work will be added for [helper_thread], and makes it an error to in the future add
    work for [helper_thread].  Furthermore, once [helper_thread] finishes with its last
    piece of work, it will revert to a general thread-pool thread.  It is OK to call
    [finished_with_helper_thread] multiple times on the same [helper_thread]; subsequent
    calls will have no effect. *)
