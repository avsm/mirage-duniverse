(** A signal manager keeps track of a set of signals to be managed and the signal handlers
    for them.  When a signal manager is managing a signal, it installs its own OCaml
    handler for that signal that records delivery of the signal.  It then later, upon
    request, will deliver the signal to all its handlers.

    Once a signal manager starts managing a signal, it never stops. *)

(** [create] creates and returns a signal manager [t].  Whenever a signal that [t] is

    the OCaml signal handler.  Therefore [thread_safe_notify_signal_delivered] must be
    thread safe. *)
