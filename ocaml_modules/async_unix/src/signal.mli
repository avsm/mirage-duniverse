(** [handle ?stop signals ~f] arranges so that whenever a signal in [signals] is
    delivered, [f] is called on that signal.  If [f] raises, then an exception will be
    raised to the monitor in effect when [handle] was called.

    Multiple calls to [handle] with the same signal will cause all the handlers to run
    when that signal is delivered, not just the last handler from the last call to
    [handle].

    The first time [handle] is called for a signal, it will install a C signal handler for
    it, replacing the existing C signal handler for that signal. *)

(** [terminating] is a list of signals that can be supplied to [handle] and whose default
    behavior is to terminate the program: [alrm hup int term usr1 usr2].

    Various signals whose [default_sys_behavior] is [`Terminate] are not included:

    {v
       | kill   | it's not allowed to be handled                            |
       | pipe   | Async already ignores this signal, since it handles EPIPE |
       | prof   | so that we can profile things with -p                     |
       | vtalrm | it already has a handler                                  | v} *)
val terminating : t list

(** [is_managed_by_async signal] returns true iff [signal] is being managed by Async, and
    hence its default behavior is no longer in effect. *)
