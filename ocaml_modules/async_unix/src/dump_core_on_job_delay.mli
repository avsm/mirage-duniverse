(** [dump_core ()] dumps a core file using [/usr/bin/gcore] if it exists, or by calling
    [abort()] if not (or with [~how_to_dump:Call_abort]).  With gcore, the dump is done in
    a child process, and the core file is written to [/tmp/core.$N.$PID], where [$PID] is
    the process id and [$N] is a counter that is incremented on each call to
    [dump_core]. *)
