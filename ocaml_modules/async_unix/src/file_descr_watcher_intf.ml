(** [File_descr_watcher_intf.S] provides an API for for watching a set of file descriptors
    to see if they are ready for reading or writing.

    We have two implementations, one using epoll, and one using select.

    None of the functions need to be thread-safe, with the exception of
    [thread_safe_check].  So that implementations can easily do non-thread-safe actions,
    checking for ready I/O is always done in three steps:

    1. [pre_check], while holding the async lock
    2. [thread_safe_check], while not holding the async lock
    3. [post_check], while holding the async lock *)

      file descriptor, whether it is being watched for read, write, or both.  If a file
      descriptor is not being watched for either, it is not in the map. *)

      false }] removes [fd] from the map. *)

      passes.  [thread_safe_check] does not side effect [t].  Unlike the rest of the

      1. for each file descriptor that is ready to be written to, then
      2. for each file descriptor that is ready to be read from.

      We handle writes before reads so that we get all the writes started going to the
      external world before we process all the reads.  This will nicely batch together
      all the output based on the reads for the next writes.

      It is guaranteed that it calls [handle_fd_read*] only on an [fd] that is watched for
      read as per [set], and [handle_fd_write*] only on an [fd] that is watched for write
      as per [set]. *)
